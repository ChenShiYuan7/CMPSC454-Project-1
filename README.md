# Image Classification of CIFAR-10 Dataset with Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network Perimeter
> This is course project for CMPEN/EE 454 - FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPUTER VISION at Penn State


For the course project, we were tasked to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model from scratch with MATLAB. Our model is a faithful implementation of a CNN, and with pre-trained perimeters, it performs well in the CIFRA-10 dataset.

Our Model follows this block diagram
